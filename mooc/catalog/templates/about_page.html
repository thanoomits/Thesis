                                <p>The platforms known as Massive Open Online Courses or MOOC are one of the biggest trends in upper education, as in recent years it has attracted the attention of experts and people from all over the world. The term ‘MOOC’ describes the free, open and global access to an online platform that offers lectures, exercises and videos to users, for the purpose of educating them. However, it is observed that many people, even in higher education, do not know what they are, but even those who know and participate most of the time stop and do not complete them. Several studies have been conducted to combat this phenomenon. One of the most efficient and interesting ways to do so, is to integrate into the platforms, features that we find in games in order to increase the interest of each user or student. One of the more efficient and interesting ways to do so, is to integrate into the platforms characteristics that we encounter in games that will satisfy the curiosity of the users. Furthermore they will offer new incentives and increase user interest by acting as catalyst for increasing course completion rates.

                                <p>In this thesis the characteristics of the multiple models of MOOCs were examined (cMOOC, xMOOC, madeMOOC, synchMOOC, etc.). Careful analysis was conducted on some of the most prevalent MOOCs of recent years such as Coursera, EdX etc. and the characteristics which they are based on. Additionally  surveys were studied on the effect that gamification has on users within the MOOC environment. With evaluation of all the above a MOOC system was created in which were integrated with gamification elements, giving the fun and interesting component needed to attract and retain users in the platform.
